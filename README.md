Transaction Processing requirements	
The main purpose of the system is to successfully capture a customer and create   a time table afterwards, this feature was successfully implemented also accounting for other basic functionalities such as creation or registration of instructors, customers and other admin stuff. Deletion and updating of user details was implemented as well.



Usability	
The interface was made in such a way that the most important tasks that the user may want to perform are easy to access, understand, and use.  A help sub-system was successfully integrated.


Minimisation of errors	
Error handling and validation was heavily implemented to make sure that errors are easily identified. This includes the use of try catch statements, string formatting and setting textboxes to allow numbers for the relevant textbox.


Learning the system
	
The system has a friendly uncluttered, user interface and every link has a tooltip explaining a task that will be executed. We designed a help system that is easy to comprehend even for the inexperienced users thus lowering the learning curve.
